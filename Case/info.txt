PS/S Keyboard Adapter for MSX2 Computers
----------------------------------------

This basic case was created by Wierzbowsky. The case was created specifically for
the cable that has DIN-13 on one end and Dupont 2x7 connectors on the other end.
Dupont connectors sit too high on the 2x7 pin header, so the case has a higher
compartment to host the cable and prevent it from bending too much.

Use black laptop screws 2x8mm to join the upper and lower parts of the case. Do
not overtighten these screws, otherwise the connection will be bad. It's also
possible to use other screws, for example 2.5x8mm for wood/plastic for the case.

The case has a hole for reprogramming the adapter and also another hole for an
optional LED board that can be made from a piece of a breadboard.
